Though Martin Luther is universally known, 
not only as the bold and uncompromising Re- 
former, but also as the author of many invaluable 
works in defence of the faith, few except his 
own countrymen are acquainted with him in the 
character of a poet and writer of spiritual songs : 
yet it was by these, scarcely less than by his 
practical and controversial writings, that he 
brought the doctrines of the Reformation home 
to the hearts and minds of the people. "Luther did 
as much," says Coleridge, " for the Reformation 
by his hymns as by his translation of the Bible. 
In Germany the hymns are known by heart by 
eveiy peasant ; they advise, they argue from the 
hymns, and every soul in the Church praises 
God, like a Christian, with words which are 
natural and yet sacred to his mind." If there 
be some exaggeration, there is also much truth 
in the remark of this highly-gifted man, and 



III. 



there can be little doubt, that the Historian of 
the Reformation, who should omit aU mention of 
these celebrated hymns, would overlook an im- 
portant element in the accomplishment of that 
mighty work. " These hymns," says a modem 
writer, to whom we are indebted for an interest- 
ing chapter on Luther and his age,^ " made a 
bond of union among men who knew little of 
Creeds and Articles: while Theologians were 
disputing about niceties of doctrine, every devout 
man could understand the blessedness of singing 
God's praises in good honest German, instead of 
gaziug idly at the mass, or listening to a Latin 
Litany : the children learnt Luther's hymns in 
the cottage, and martyrs sang them on the 
scaffold." Many are the stories current in Ger- 
many respecting the effects of these hynms on 
the minds of the people. A pious man in 
Venice, upon reading Luther's Paraphrase of the 
Lord's Prayer, without knowing its Author, is 
said to have cried out : " Blessed is the womb 
that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast 
sucked." An eye-witness of the Reformation 
says of the hymn, " Dear Christians one and aU 
rejoice,"^ "who can doubt that by this hymn many

hundreds of Christians have been converted to the 
faith of Jesus, who had never before heard of 
the name of Luther? but his noble and dear 
words won their hearts over to the reception of 
the truth ; so that, in my opinion, the spiritual 
songs have contributed not a Uttle to the spread 
of the Gospel." 

It would, however, be a great mistake to 
attribute the popularity of these hymns altogether 
to the intrinsic merit of the poetry. There is 
no originahty of thought, no splendid imagery, 
no play of fancy calculated to attract the reader, 
whose taste has been formed on the productions 
of the nineteenth century ; but there is a simple 
beauty, a homely strength and plainness of 
language, and above all, a scriptural truth, which 
found their way to every heart in that less 
refined age. There is also a melody in the 
verses, which admirably fitted them for Church 
music. Many of the tunes were composed by 
Luther himself, and others were selected by him 
from those touching popular airs in which Ger- 
many has been always so rich. 

It may not be amiss to hint at a few of the 
causes, which contributed to the prodigious efiect 
produced by these hymns at the time of the 
Eeformation, as well as to the permanent hold 



V. 



which they have since kept upon the minds of 
the German people. The light of the Gospel 
had by God's grace again risen upon benighted 
Christendom ; Luther's translation of the Bible 
was already in the hands of the people, and was 
read by them with eagerness ; their minds were 
opening to the light, their hearts were tuned to 
praise; but there were no suitable hymns, where- 
in they could give utterance to their newly 
awakened feelings. There were indeed hymns 
of the Ancient Catholic Church, of some merit, 
and great antiquity, but they were written in 
Latin; there were likewise some fine old German 
hymns, still favourites with the people ; but they 
were few in number, scattered here and there, 
and disfigured by Popish additions; gems of their 
kind, but dimmed by the dust of ages, and still 
worse incrustations of Popery. 

Luther, himself a great lover of music and 
poetry, knew too well the influence of these 
fascinating arts over the susceptible minds of his 
countrymen, to neglect so powerfiil a means of 
advancing the great cause of the Reformation. 
Accordingly he appUed himself vigorously to the 
task of reviving congregational singing, of which 
Christendom had been for centuries deprived. 
In this, as in other stages of his extraordinary 



VI. 



career, he shewed himself to be no rash and 
reckless innovator, who delighted in puUing down 
rather than in building up. He carefully sought 
out and retained whatever was true and valuable. 
He translated some of the hymns of the Ancient 
Catholic Church from Latin into German. He 
altered, improved, and gave a more Christian 
tone to some of the old hymns already alluded 
to, sometimes adding a new stanza to the old 
one with such such singular skill, that it seemed 
always to have belonged to it. Thus these 
hymns possessed the double advantage of being 
at one and the same time the cherished relics of 
antiquity, and the spring flowers of evangeUcal 
poetry, which the genial light and warmth of the 
Reformation had wakened into life. The per- 
mission to sing God's praises, as in the primitive 
ages of the Church, was a precious boon to the 
people. They who had been so long, in their 
public worship, the mere spectators of a Latin 
service which they could not understand, now 
poured out their hearts in words, which were not 
only sweet and famihar to their ears, but also 
pregnant with evangelical truth ; no wonder that 
they learnt to associate them with all that is 
true, and pure, and holy ; no wonder that they 
treasured them up as sacred deposits, out of 



VII. 



which they might bring forth things new and 
old, to comfort the aflSdcted, to instruct the 
ignorant, and to glorify Him who had done such 
great things for them. 

Another cause of the popularity of these 
hymns may be traced to their coincidence in 
time, and identity in language, with Luther's 
new translation of the Bible. It must not be 
forgotten that Luther wrote for the people. He 
felt strongly, that since it was an especial privilege 
of the poor to have the Gospel preached to them, 
it ought to be preached in a language natural 
and familiar, and unembarrassed by conventional 
and scientific terms. Accordingly when he 
set about his great task of translating the 
Bible, he spared no pains in bringing to per- 
fection his plain strong mother tongue, at that 
time rough and unpolished, Hke ore in the mine, 
but capable of being moulded by the hand of a 
master into an admirable instrument for the 
expression of those great and saving truths, so 
long hidden from the eyes of the people, and 
so wondrously brought to hght by the Reforma- 
tion. With what complete success this great 
and necessary work of reforming the language 
was attended is well known ; the Reformation 
of the faith, and that of the German language. 



VIII. 



both date from the same era, both acknowledge 
Luther as their Author. 

It seems necessary to say a few words upon 
the plan which I have proposed to myself in 
executing the translation. My first aim has been 
to give the meaning of the original with accuracy 
and fidelity, for if these be essential to every 
good translation, they seem to be especially so 
to the translation of hymns like Luther's ; since 
the slightest mistake, or, in some cases, even the 
change of a word, might involve the change of 
a doctrine, and thus destroy the interest which 
they possess, as a short and plain Epitome of 
the great Keformer's views. 

My next aim has been to imitate the sim- 
ple, idiomatic, biblical language of the original, 
for any attempt at finery or embellishment would 
mar the simplicity which constitutes their chief 
charm. I have also endeavoured, so far as I 
could do so without affectation, to throw an air of 
archaic dignity over them by using language 
somewhat older and more quaint than that in 
common use, feeling that Luther would be as 
unlike himself in the language of the present 
day as the portrait of a man of the sixteenth in 
the costume of the nineteenth century. With 
the view of preserving still further the peculiari- 



IX. 



ties of the original, I have, with few exceptions, 
employed the same metres; I must else have 
sacrificed the rhythm and melody for which the 
hymns are so remarkable, and rendered them 
unsuitable for being sung to the fine old 
Lutheran tunes. I am aware that some of 
these metres will appear at first rather strange 
to an English ear ; but it must not be inferred 
that they are irregular and capricious: on the 
contrary, many of them are very skilfully con- 
structed, and some on the model of the Greek 
verse. 

It seems to have been a favourite device of 
Luther's, as indeed it was of many of our English 
poets, to relieve the more stately march of the 
of the Iambic by alternating it with the brisker 
measure of the Trochee, as in the following 
examples. P. 11 — 

All praise to Jesus^ hallowed name, 
Who of virgin pure became, &c. 

Again, p. 59, we have a good specimen of the 
intermixture of Iambic and Trochaic measure in 
" The BeHef." In p. 75, the two first lines are 
Troch. dimeter, the third is Troch. dimeter 
cataleptic, and the last consists of a ditrochee 
followed by a diiambus. In p. 78, we have in 



X. 



the original a double stanza repeated three 
times, the first part of which (der aufgesang) 
consists of — 

1. Iamb, trimeter catalectic. 

2. Troch. dim. 

3. The same as the first. 

4. Diamb. followed by ditrochee 

1. Gott sei I gel6|bet und | gebe|nedei|et, 

2. Der una J selber | hat gejspelset | 

3. Mit seilnem Flelslche und | mit sei|nem Blu|te ! 

4. Das gib I uns Herr | Gdtt zu | gute. 

In the second part (der abgesang) the two first 
lines are made up of a ditrochee followed by a 
dactylic dim. the third is formed of two amphi- 
macers, and the fourth is a troch. dim. cat. 
thus — 

1. Herr, durch | delnen || heiligen | Leichnam, 

2. Der von | delner || Mutter Ma|ria kam, 

3. Und das heillige Blut, | 

4. Hilf uns, I Herr, aus || aller | Noth. 

The English language does not well admit of 
the adoption of this metre in every particular, 
but it will be found that the translation agrees 
in its general character, and that it is equally 
suited to the music. It would be tedious to 



XI. 



enter into further details ; the little I have said 
may serve to prevent a hasty conclusion, that 
because the metres are unusual they are there- 
fore irregular, and may perhaps induce those 
who are curious in such things to pursue the 
subject for themselves. 

Such were the views with which I entered 
upon my task; how far I have succeeded in 
carrying them out my readers must decide, and 
especially that portion of them who under- 
stand German, and are therefore capable of judg- 
ing whether the copy bears a faithful resemblance 
to the original. There is, indeed, a close analogy 
between the task of the translator and that of 
the portrait painter : both have the same object 
to attain, the same difficulties to surmount. The 
object is not only to make a true and faithful, 
but a lively and expressive copy of the original ; 
the difficulty consists in not only copying the 
general outline and features of the countenance, 
but in imparting to them that life and expression 
without which the likeness cannot be a satisfactory 
one ; still less will it satisfy those whose minds 
are deeply impressed with the beauty and loveli- 
ness of the original, and who regard with disap- 
pointment and jealousy any failure in this respect. 
Industry and perseverance may accomplish the 



XII. 



former, but the latter and more difficult part of 
the work requires the hand of a master, and for 
such a one Luther must, I fear, yet wait. " His 
harp still hangs upon the willow, disdaining 
the touch of any hand less skilful than 
his own." Yet I would fain hope that 
even in the imperfect dress which I have 
been able to give them, hymns which for more 
than three hundred years have been sung with 
enthusiasm by the German people, not only in 
the Churches of Germany, but even in the field 
and cottage, may touch a responsive chord in the 
hearts of their Anglo-saxon brethren, and tend 
in some small degree to uphold the great doc- 
trines, which it has been too common for men in 
our day to viUfy and decry. 

For my own part, the longer I live, the more 
I learn to bless God for the Reformation and the 
Reformers, and the more I feel convinced that 
in a firm adherence to their doctrines and princi- 
ples, so admirably embodied in our Articles, 
Liturgy, and Homilies, lies the best safety of 
our Church amid the perils which surround her. 

Among these Reformers none stands so pre- 
eminent as Martin Luther, and why does he so ? 
not only because he was the first to lay the axe 
to the root of the tree, but because he was pre- 



xiir. 



eminently a man of faith. It was faith, living 
active faith, which enabled him at his Master's 
bidding to walk fearlessly on the stormy sea 
through which his path lay ; it was faith which 
enabled him to brave Popes, Devils, and Em- 
peror, and prompted the heroic reply when he was 
dissuaded from going to Worms, "I will go for- 
ward though there were as many devils in 
Worms, as tiles on the houses." Faith breathes 
in every Une of that Hymn of Triumph 
Eine feste Burg ist unser Gott, 

which still exercises so potent a spell over the 
hearts of the German people, and was, as Ranke 
well observes, " the product of the moment in 
which Luther, engaged in a conflict with a world 
of foes, sought strength in the conciousness that 
he was defending a divine cause which could 
never perish." 

May God give us a like precious faith, that 
"being steadfast therein, joyful through hope, 
and rooted in charity, we may so pass the waves 
of this troublesome world, that finally we may 
come to the land of eternal Ufe."

In the arrangement of the hymns I have 
followed that adopted in a neat little edition, 
Nutt, Fleet St. London, which being of a uniform 
size may be conveniently bound up with the 
translation. I have not, however, followed the 
Editor in his occasional deviations from the 
text, but have in all doubtful cases referred to 
the beautiful edition of Wackemagel, who has 
judiciously adhered to the original text. 

I gladly avail myself of this opportunity of 
thanking the kind friends, from whom I have 
received aid and encouragement ; and amongst 
others, I would especially acknowledge my 
obligations to the Rev. H. G. Bunsen, of 
Lilleshall, by whom my translation has been 
carefully revised, a task for which his almost 
equal acquaintance with both languages peculiarly 
fitted him. 

I have Ukewise to thank a musical friend, 
with whose kind assistance the words have been 
carefully adapted to the music as arranged in 
" Filitz's Choralbuch," and Layritz's Kern des 
Deutschen Earchengesangs, to which the refer- 
ences are given in the index. A little humour- 
ing will however be occasionally required, such

as playing two crotchets in the place of a minim 
and vice vers^, and attention must likewise be 
paid to the dots of repetition.

That it is good, and pleasing to God, for us to 
sing spiritual songs is, I think, a truth whereof 
no Christian can be ignorant, since not only the 
example of the Prophets and Kings in the Old 
Testament, (who praised God with singing and 
music, poesy and aU kinds of stringed instru- 
ments,) but also the like practice of all Christen- 
dom from the beginning, especially in respect of 
Psalms, is well known to every one: yea, St. 
Paul doth also appoint the same, 1 Corinthians 
14, and command the Colossians in the 3rd 



XIX. 



chapter to sing spiritual songs and psalms from 
the heart unto the Lord, that thereby the 
word of God and Christian doctrine be in every 
way furthered and practised. 

Accordingly, to make a good beginning, and 
to encourage others who can do it better, 
I have myself, with some others, put together 
a few hymns, in order to bring into Ml 
play the blessed Gospel, which by God's 
grace hath again risen : that we may boast 
as Moses doth in his sopg, Exodus 15, that 
Christ is become our praise and song, and 
that, whether we sing or speak, we may not 
know anything save Christ our Sa\dour, as St. 
Paul saith, 1 Cor. 2. 

These songs have been set in four parts, 
for no other reason than because I wished 
to provide our young people (who both will 
and ought to be instructed in music and other 
sciences) with something whereby they might 
rid themselves of amorous and carnal songs, 



XX. 



and in their stead learn something whole- 
some, and so apply themselves to what is 
good with pleasure, as becometh the young. 

Besides this, I am not of opinion, that all 
sciences should be beaten down and made to 
cease by the Gospel, as some fanatics pretend; 
but I would fain see aU the arts, and music 
in particular, used in the service of Him, 
who hath given and created them. 

Therefore I entreat every pious Christian 
to give a favourable reception to these hymns, 
and to help forward my undertaking accord- 
ing as God hath given him more or less 
ability. The world is alas! too idle and 
indisposed to train and teach our poor youth, 
so that we ought not in any way to give occa- 
sion thereto. God grant us His grace. Amen. 

We have also, by way of good example, in- 
troduced into this little book the sacred songs of 



XXI. 



holv writ, which the blessed Patriarchs and 
Prophets of old did compose and sing, that 
we may not be looked upon as innovators 
in this matter, but be able to point to the 
example of holy men in our favour. There- 
fore every Christian will see how these saints 
of old do praise (even as we do) not the 
works of men but the grace of God only, 
which surely ought not to be condemned, as we 
are, even though like us it should be despised. 

15 4 5. 

The 96th Psalm saith : " sing to the Lord 
a new song, sing to the Lord all the earth." 
The service of God in the old Covenant, 
under the law of Moses, was very hard and 
wearisome, as they were obliged to offer up many 
and divers kinds of sacrifices of all that they 
had, both in the house and in the field, and this 
the people, who were idle and covetous, did very 
grudgingly, or for the sake of temporal advantage; 

XXII. 



as the Prophet Malachi saith, 1st chapter : 
"who is there even among you, that would 
shut the doors for naught? neither do ye 
kindle fires on my altars for naught." But 
where there is such an idle and grudging 
heart, there can be no singing at all, or at least 
no singing of what is good. When we sing, both 
heart and mind should be cheerful and merry. 
Therefore God hath allowed such idle and 
grudging service to perish, as He saith fiirther : 
"I have no pleasure in you saith the Lord 
of Hosts, neither will I accept an offering at 
your hand : for from the rising of the sun 
even to the going down thereof my name 
shall be great among the Gentiles ; and in 
every place incense shall be offered in my 
name and a pure offering ; for my name 
shall be great among the Heathen, saith the 
Lord of Hosts." 

Therefore there is now in the new Cov- 
enant a better service, whereof the Psalm 
speaketh : " sing to the Lord a new song, 

XXIII. 



slug to the Lord all the earth." For God 
hath made our heart and mind cheerful thro' 
His dear Son, whom He hath given for us, 
to redeem us from sin, death, and the devil. 
He who believeth this in earnest, cannot help 
singing and speaking thereof cheerfully and 
with pleasure, that others may hear it like- 
wise, and be attracted thereby. But when any 
man will not sing and speak of it, it is a 
sign that he doth not believe it, and that 
he doth not belong to the cheerful new 
Covenant, but to the old, dull, and joyless 
Covenant of the Law. 

St. Paul writes to the Thessalonians, that 
they should not sorrow for the dead, as others 
who have no hope, but should comfort one 
another with God's word, as they who have 
a sure hope of the life and resurrection of 
the dead. 

For that they should sorrow, who have no 
hope, is not to be wondered at, nor indeed 

XXIV. 



are they to be blamed for it, since being 
shut out from the faith of Christ they must 
either regard and love the present life only, 
and be loth to lose it, or after this life 
look for everlasting death, and the wrath 
of God in hell, and be unwilling to go 
thither. 

But we Christians, who have been redeemed 
from all this by the precious blood of the 
Son of God, should by faith accustom 
ourselves to despise death, to regard it 
as a deep, soimd, and sweet sleep, the 
coffin no other than the bosom of our Lord 
Christ or paradise, and the grave as a gentle 
resting place ; as indeed it is in the sight 
of God, for St. John saith : 11. " Our friend 
Lazarus sleepeth," and Matt. 9. we read, "The 
maid is not dead but sleepeth." 

Likewise also St. Paul in 1 Corinthians 15. 
doth put out of sight the imlovely appearance 



XXV. 



of death in our dying body, and bring 
forward instead all the lovely and beautiful 
features of life, when he saith : " It is sown 
in corruption, it is raised in incomiption : 
it is sown in dishonour, (that is, in an ugly 
and vile form) it is raised in glory. It 
is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. 
It is sown a natural body, it is raised a 
spiritual body." 

Accordingly we have swept clean away from 
our Churches all the Popish abominations, such 
as vigils, masses for the dead, obsequies, pur- 
gatory, and all the other mummeries which 
are practised for the dead, and will no more 
permit our Churches to be looked upon as places 
of lamentation and mourning, but rather as 
the Fathers named them "Cemeteries," that 
is, resting and sleeping places. 

Therefore we sing no songs of mourn- 
ing or lamentation over the grave, but 
cheerful songs of the forgiveness of sins, 

XXVI. 



rest, sleep, and the life] and resurrection of the 
dead in Christ, in order that our faith may 
be strengthened, and the people stirred up to 
proper devotion. 

For it is right and reasonable, that we 
should pay due honour to the burial of the 
dead, and perform the funeral rites in a way 
becoming that cheerful article of our creed, the 
resurrection of the dead, and in defiance of 
the dreadful enemy, Death, who so shamefully 
and continually preyeth upon us in every horrid 
shape and manner. 

Accordingly, as we read, the holy Patriarchs, 
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, &c., kept their 
burials with great pomp, and ordered them 
with much diligence ; and afterwards the Kings 
of Judah paid great honour to the bodies of 
the dead using incense of divers costly spices 
over them, in order to rob death of its 
horrors, and to honoiu* and confess openly the 
resurrection of the dead, that they might thereby 
comfort the weak in faith and sorrowful in heart. 



XXVII. 



To this likewise belongeth, what Christians 
have always done in respect of the bodies 
and graves of the dead, treating them with 
honour, decorating them, singing over them, 
and adorning them with monuments. It is of the 
greatest importance that we be firmly settled 
in this doctrine of the resurrection; for it is 
our lasting, blessed, and eternal comfort and 
joy, against death, hell, the devil and all 
melancholy. 

Therefore that such beautiful ornament of 
music, properly used, may tend to the glory 
of our blessed Creator and the edifying of 
Christians, that He be praised and honoured, 
and that we, having His holy Word impressed 
on the heart by sweet songs, be bettered and 
strengthened in the faith, may God the Father, 
Son, and Holy Ghost mercifully grant. Amen.

False masters now abound, who songs indite ; 
Beware of them, and learn to judge them right : 
Where God builds up His Church and Word, hard by- 
Satan is found with murder and a lie.

Sayioitk of the heathen, known 
As the promised virgin's Son, 
Come, Thou wonder of the earth, 
God ordained Thee such a birth. 

Lo ! He comes ! the Lord of all 
Leaves His bright and royal hall, 
God and man, with giant force, 
Hastening to run His course. 

To the Father, whence He came, 
He returns with brighter fame ; 
Down to hell He goes alone. 
Then ascends to God's high throne.

Thou, the Father's equal, win 
Victory in the flesh o'er sin ; 
So shall man, though weak and frail. 
By th' indwelling God prevail. 

On Thy lowly manger Night 
Sheds a pure unwonted light ; 
Darkness must not enter here. 
Faith abides in simshine clear. 

God the Father, God the Son, 
Praised be by every one, 
God the Holy Ghost adore. 
Now, henceforth, and evermore.

A child's song at chbistmas, concerning 

THE LITTLE CHILD JESUS. 

(1535.) 

Feom highest heaven, on joyous wing, 
I come to you good news to bring ; 
Good news I bring, a plenteous store, 
Whereof my song shall tell you more. 

For imto you, this happy mom. 
Of virgin meek and pure is bom 
A holy child, a gentle boy, 
To be your bliss and chiefest joy. 

It is the Christ, our God indeed. 
The very help poor sinners need ; 
He will himself your Saviour be, 
From sin and sorrow set you free. 



3 



To vou the blessedness He bears, 
Which God the Father's love prepares, 
That, in His heavenly kingdom blest, 
You may with us for ever rest. 

So mark ye well the signs I shew, 
The swaddHng bands and manger low ; 
There shall ye find the young child laid, 
By whom the imiverse was made. 

Then let us all right merry be, 
And with the shepherds go and see 
The gift which God to us hath given. 
His own dear Son, sent down from heaven. 

Mark thou, my heart, look well mine eyes. 
What yonder in the manger lies ! 
What child is that so wondrous fair ? 
The little Jesus lieth there. 

Welcome, thrice welcome, noble guest ! 
The sinner's friend, the mourner's rest ; 
For coming thus to grief and me. 
How can I thank thee worthily ? 



Ah ! mighty Lord, who madest all, 
How couldst Thou make Thyself so small, 
To lie upon the coarse dry grass. 
The fo^d of humble ox and ass ? 

And were the world ten times as wide. 
With gold and jewels beautified. 
It would be far too small to be 
A little cradle, Lord, for Thee. 

Thy silk and velvet are coarse hay, 
Thy swaddling bands the mean array. 
With which e'en Thou, a king so great, 
Art clad as with a robe of state. 

And thus, perhaps, it pleased Thee 
To make this truth quite plain to me. 
That worldly honour, wealth, and might, 
Are mean and worthless in Thy sight. 

Ah ! Jesus, lay thy gentle head. 
And make Thyself a clean soft bed 
Here in the comer of my heart, 
That I and Thou may never part :. 



So will I ever joyful be, 
And sing and dance right merrily. 
As mothers sing, the cradle nigh. 
Their sweetest softest lullaby. 

Now praise we God on His high throne. 
Who giveth us His only Son ! 
Such the good news the angels bring, 
Such the new year of which they sing.

(1543.) 

To shepherds, as they watched by night, 
Appeared a troop of angels bright ; 
Behold the tender babe, they said, 
In yonder lowly manger laid, 

At Bethlehem, in David's town. 
As Mieah did of old make known ; 
'Tis Jesus Christ your Lord and King, 
Who doth to all salvation bring. 

Rejoice ye, then, that through His Son 
God is with sinners now at one ; 
Made Hke yourselves of flesh and blood. 
Your brother is th' eternal Good. 



What harm can sin and death then do ? 
The true God now abides with you : 
Let Hell and Satan chide and chafe, 
God is your fellow — ^ye are safe. 

Not one He will, nor can forsake 
Who Him his confidence doth make : 
Let all hifl wiles the Tempter try, 
You may his utmost powers defy. 

You must prevail at last, for ye 
Are now become God's £unily : 
To God for ever give ye praise. 
Patient and cheerM all your days. 

Amen.

Now praise we Christ, the Holy One, 
The spotless virgin Mary's Son, 
Far as the blessed sun doth shine, 
E'en to the world's remote confine. 

He, who Himself all things did make, 
A servant's form vouchsafed to take, 
That He as man mankind might win, 
And save His creatures from their sin. 

The grace of God th' Almighty Lord 
On the chaste mother was outpour'd ; 
A virgin pure and imdefil'd 
In wondrous wise conceived a child. 



The holy maid became th' abode 
And temple of the living Grod, 
And she, who knew not man, was blest 
With God's own Word made manifest. 

The noble mother bare a Son, 
For so did Gabriel's promise nm. 
Whom John confest and leapt with joy. 
Ere yet the mother knew her boy. 

In a rude manger stretch'd on hay, 
In poverty content He lay ; 
With milk was fed the Lord of all, 
Who feeds the ravens when they call. 

Th' angelic choir rejoice, and raise 
Their voice to God in songs of praise ; 
To humble shepherds is proclaimed 
The Shepherd, who the world hath framed. 

Honour to thee, O Christ, be paid. 
Pure offspring of a holy maid. 
With Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, 
Till time in time's abyss be lost.

(1524.) 

All praise to Jesus' hallowed name, 
Who of virgin pure became 
True man for us ! The angels sing, 
As the glad news to earth they bring. 

Hallelujah ! 

The everlasting Father's Son 
For a manger leaves His throne ; 
The mighty God, th' eternal Good, 
Hath clothed Himself in flesh and blood. 

Hallelujah ! 

He whom the world could not inwrap 
Yonder lies in Mary's lap ; 
He is become an infant small. 
Who by His might upholdeth all. 

Hallelujah ! 



11 



Th' eternal Light come down from heaven 
Hath to us new sunshine given ; 
It shineth in the midst of night, 
And maketh us the sons of light. 

Hallelujah ! 

The Father's Son, God everblest, 
In the world became a guest ; 
He leads us from this vale of tears, 
And makes us in His kingdom heirs. 

Hallelujah ! 

He came to earth so mean and poor, 
Man to pity and restore, 
And make us rich in heaven above. 
Equal with angels through His love. 

Hallelujah ! 

All this He did to shew His grace 
To our poor and sinful race ; 
For this let Christendom adore 
And praise his name for evermore. 

HaUelujah ! 



12 



(1541.) 

Why, Herod, unrelenting foe ! 
Doth the Lord's coming move thee so ? 
He doth no earthly kingdom seek, 
Who brings His kingdom to the meek. 

Led by the star the wise men find 
The Light that lightens all mankind ; 
The threefold presents which they bring 
Declare Him God, and Man, and King. 

In Jordan's sacred waters stood 
The meek and heavenly Lamb of God, 
And He who did no sin, thereby 
Cleansed us from all iniquity ! 



And now a miracle was done ; 
Six waterpots stood there of stone, 
Christ spake the word with power divine, 
The water reddened into wine. 

All honour unto Christ be paid. 
Pure offspring of the holy maid, 
With Father and with Holy Ghost, 
TiU time in endless time be lost.

Leading Sin herself in chains.

For our sin the sinless Saviour 
Bare the heavy wrath of God ; 
Reconciling us, that favour 
Might be shewn us through His blood. 

Kyrie eleison. 

In His hands He hath for ever 
Mercy, Life, and Sin, and Death ;

All who come to Him in faith.

Chbist lay awhile in Death's strong bands, 

For our offences given ; 
But now at God's right hand He stands, 
And brings us life from heaven : 
Wherefore let us joyful be, 
And sing to God right thankfully 
Loud songs of Hallelujah .! 

HaUelujah ! 

No man from Death could victory win. 

O'er all mankind he reigned ; 
Alas ! that cometh of our sin, 

There was not one unstained : 
Wherefore Death in triumph came, 
And over us a right did claim ; 
He held us all in thraldom. 

Hallelujah I 

Christ Jesus, God's own Son, came down. 
That He might us deliver. 



16 



And sin destroying, took his crown 
From Death's pale brows for ever : 
Stript of power, no more he reigns ; 
An empty Shape alone remains ; 
His sting is lost for ever. 

HaUelujah ! 

It was a strange and dreadM strife. 
When Life and Death contended ; 

The victory remained with Life, 
The reign of Death was ended : 

Holy Scripture plainly saith. 

That Death is swallowed up by Death, 

Made henceforth a derision. 

Hallelujah ! 

Here the true Paschal Lamb we see, 

Whom God so freely gave us ; 
He died on the accursed tree 

So strong His love ! to save us : 

See ! His blood doth mark our door, 

Faith points to it. Death passes o*er, 

The Murderer cannot harm us. 

Hallelujah ! 
17 



So let us keep the festival, 

Whereto the Lord invites us ; 
Christ is Himself the joy of all, 

The Sun which warms and lights us ; 
£7 His grace He doth impart 
Eternal sunshine to the heart ; 
The night of sin is ended. 

Hallelujah ! 

Then let us feast this Easter-day 

On the true Bread of heaven ; 
The Word of grace hath purged away 

The old and wicked leaven : 
Christ alone our soids will feed. 
He is our meat and drink indeed ; 
Faith lives upon no other. 

HaUelujah !

Come, Holy Ghost, Lord God, fulfil 
With Thy rich grace, heart, mind, and will, 
And each believing soul inspire 
With Thine own pure and holy fire. 
Lord, by the brightness of Thy light, 
Thou in the faith dost men unite 
Of every land and every tongue ; 
This to Thy praise, O Lord, be sung. 

Hallelujah ! Hallelujah ! 

Thou holy Light and Guide divine, 
O cause the Word of life to shine ; 
Teach us to know our God aright. 
And call Him Father with delight. 
Keep us, O Lord, from all strange lore. 
That we may seek no masters more. 
But with true faith in Christ abide, 
And heartily in Him confide. 

Hallelujah ! Hallelujah !

Sweet source of comfort, holy Love, 
Send us Thy succour from above, 
That in Thy service we may stay. 
And troubles drive us not away. 
Lord, with Thy grace our souls refresh. 
Confirm our frail and feeble flesh. 
That we through life and death to Thee 
May press with Christian chivalry.

Deab is to me the Holy Maid, 

I never can forget her ; 
For glorious things of her are said ; 
Than life I love her better : 

So dear and good, 

That if I should 

Afflicted be, 

It moves not me ; 
For she my soid wiU ravish 
With constancy and love's pure fire, 
And with her bounty lavish 
Fulfil my heart's desire. 

She wears a crown of purest gold, 
Twelve shining stars attend her ; 

Her raiment, glorious to behold, 
Surpasses far in splendour 



27 



The sun at noon ; 

Upon the moon 

She stands, the Bride 

Of Him who died : 
Sore travail is upon her ; 
She bringeth forth a noble Son, 
Whom aU the world doth honour ; 
She bows before His throne. 

Thereat the Dragon raged, and stood 

With open mouth before her ; 
But yain was his attempt, for God 
His buckler broad threw o'er her. 

Up to His throne 

He caught His Son, 

But left the foe 

To rage below. 
The mother, sore afflicted. 
Alone into the desert fled, 
There by her God protected. 
By her true Father fed.

The mouth of fools doth God confess, 
But while their lips draw nigh Him, 

Their heart is full of wickedness. 
And all their deeds deny Him. 

Corrupt are they, and every one 

Ahominable deeds hath done ; 

There is not one well-doer. 

The Lord looked down from His high tower 

On all mankind below Him, 
To see if any owned his power. 

And truly sought to know Him, 
Who all their understanding bent 
To search His holy Word, intent 
To do His will in earnest.

APPLIED BY LUTHER TO HIS OWN TIMES. 

(1524.) 

Ah God ! look down from heaven and see 
A sight which well may move Thee, 

Of godly men how few there be, 
How lonely we who love Thee ; 

Withheld is thy pure word, the light 

Of faith itself extinguished quite 

In all the sons of Adam. 

Fictions they teach with cunning art. 

And lies of man's invention ; 
Not built on God's own Word, their heart 

Is full of strange dissension : 
One chooses this, another that, 
And while they make us separate. 
They boast their seeming union. 



32 



God would root out all heresy, 
And of false teachers rid us ; 

Whereto they say, Tush, who is he 
Who shall our speech forbid us ? 

We have the right and might alone. 

And what we say must stand, we own 

No other Lord or Master. 

Wherefore, saith God, I will arise 

Because of the deep sighing 
Of him who sore afflicted lies. 

For I have heard his crying : 
My Word, endued with saving might, 
Shall suddenly the wicked smite. 
And be the poor man's comfort. 

As silver in the furnace tried 

Seven times to purify it, 
The Word of God doth so abide. 

The more we search and try it ; 
But in the Cross it shows most bright, 
And manifests its strength and light, 
Throughout the earth's dark places. 



33 



O God, preseyye it pure and >free 
From this, world's generation. 

And let us be preserved by, Thee 
From all contaminatioa: 

The wicked walk about at ease, 

When loose ungodly men like these . 

Are in the land exalted.

Had God not come, may Israel say,

A remnant now, and handful small,

Who cruelly dppress us. •

What though the world should swarm with fiends 

Eager to tear and rend us, 
We will not fear, if God befriends. 
Success shall yet attend us ; 
The Prince who rules below 
No harm can do us, though 
He looks so fierce and grim ; 
For Christ hath judged him ; 
A little word can slay him. 

Leave us they must Thy blessed Word, 

For which no thanks they merit ; 
With us abideth still the Lord, 
His gifts and Holy Spirit : 
Take, if they will, our life. 
Goods, honour, child, and wife, 
We freely let them go ! 
They profit not the foe ; 
With us remains the kingdom.

CONCERNING TWO CHBI8TIAN MABTYRS 
BUBNT AT BRUSSELS, IN THK YEAB 1523, BY THE 

SOPHISTS OP LOUVAIN 

(1524.) 

By help of God I fain would tell 

A new and wondrous story, 
And sing a marvel that befel 

To His great praise and glory. 
At Brussels in the Netherlands 

He hath his banner lifted. 
To shew His wonders by the hands 

Of two youths highly gifted 

With rich and heavenly graces. 



One of these youths was called John, 

And Henry was the other. 
Rich in the grace of God was one, 

A Christian true his brother. 
For God's dear Word they shed their blood, 

And from the world departed 
Like bold and pious sons of God ; 

Faithful and lion-hearted, 

They won the crown of martyrs. 

40 



The old Arch-fiend did them immure, 

To terrify them seeking ; 
They bade them God's dear Word abjure, 

And fain would stop their speaking. 
From Louvain many Sophists came 

Versed deeply in the schools. 
And met together at the game ; 

The Spirit made them fools. 

They could not but be losers. 

Now sweet, now harsher tones they tried. 

In artifice abounding ; 
The youths did firm as rocks abide. 

The Sophists all confounding. 
The enemy waxed fierce in hate, 

And for their life blood thirsted ; 
He fumed and chafed that one so great 

Should by two babes be worsted. 

And straightway sought to bum them. 

Their monkish garb from them they take, 

And gown of ordination ; 
The youths a cheerftd Amen spake, 

And shewed no hesitation. 



41 



They thanked their God, that by His aid 

They now had been denuded 
Of Satan's mock and masquerade, 

Whereby he had deluded 

The world with false pretences. 

Thus by the power of grace they were 

True priests of God*s own making, 
Who offered up themselves e'en there, 

Christ's holy orders taking ; 
Dead to the world they cast aside 

Hypocrisy's sour leaven, 
That penitent and justified 

They might go clean to Heaven, 

And leave aU monkish follies. 

They then were told that they must read 

A note which was dictated ; 
They straightway wrote their faith and creed, 

And not one jot abated. 
Now mark their heresy ! "We must 

In God be firm believers,' 
In mortal men not pul; our trust, 

For they are all deceiveris ;'• ' 

For this they must be burned. 

42 



Two fires were lit, the youths were brought, 

But all were seized with wonder 
To see them set the flames at naught, 

And stood as struck with thunder. 
With joy they came in sight of all. 

And sang aloud God's praises ; 
The Sophists' courage waxed small 

Before such wondrous traces 

Of God's Almighty finger. 

The scandal they repent, and would 

Right gladly gloss it over, 
They dare not boast their deed of blood. 

But seek the stain to cover ; 
They feel the shame within their breast, 

And charge therewith each other ; 
But now^ the Spirit cannot rest. 

For Abel 'gainst his brother 

Doth cry aloud for vengeance. 

Their ashes never cease to cry. 

The fires are ever flaming. 
Their dust throughout the world doth fly. 

Their murderer's shame proclaiming : 

43 



] 



The voices, which with cruel hands 

They put to silence living, 
Are heard, though dead, throughout all lands 

Their testimony giving. 

And loud Hosannahs singing. 

From lies to lies they still proceed. 

And feign forthwith a story 
To colour o'er the murderous deed ; 

Their conscience pricks them sorely. 
These saints of God e'en after death 

They slandered, and asserted. 
The youths had with their latest breath 

Confest, and been converted. 

Their heresy renouncing. 



Then let them still go on and lie, 
They cannot win a blessing ; 

And let us thank God heartily, 
His word again possessing. 

Summer is even at our door, 
The winter now hath vanished. 

The tender flowerets spring once more. 
And He, who winter banished. 
Will send a happy summer.

PARAPHRASE OF THE SIXTY-SEVENTH PSALM. 

I. 

(1524.) 

May God bestow on us His grace, 

With blessings rich provide us, 
And may the brightness of His face 

To life eternal guide us ; 
That we His gracious work may know. 

And what is His good pleasure, 
And also to the Heathen shew 

Christ's riches without measure. 

And unto God convert them. 

To Thee let all the Heathen bring 

Their joyful gratulations, 
And all the world rejoice and sing 

With psalms and acclamations ; 
For Thou, O God, wilt judge the earth. 

Nor suffer sin to flourish ; 

45 



The land no more shall mourn her dearth, 
Thy word shall keep and nourish 
In righteous paths {(llpeople. 

O let the people praise Thy worth, 

In all good works increasing ; 
The land shall plenteous fruit bring forth, 

Thy word is rich in blessing. 
Let God the Father, God the Son, 

And. Holy Spirit bless U9, 
To whom by all be honour done ; 

Let solemn awe possess us. 

Yea fear Him all ye people. 

Amen. . Amen.

(1523.) 

Deab Christians one and all rejoice. 
With exultation springing, 

And with united heart and voice 
And holy rapture singing 

Proclaim the wonders God hath done, 

How His right arm the victory won ; 
Eight dearly it hath cost Him. 

Fast bound in Satan*s chains I lay. 
Death brooded darkly o'er me. 

Sin was my torment night and day, 
Therein my mother bore me ; 

Deeper and deeper still I fell. 

Life was become a living hell, 
So firmly Sin possest me. 



47 



My good works so imperfect were, 
They had no power to aid me ; 

Freewill God's judgments could not bear, 
Yea — prone to evil made me : 

Grief drove me to despair, and I 

Had nothing left me but to die ; 
To hell I fast was sinking. 

Then God beheld my wretched state 

With deep commiseration ; 
He thought upon His mercy great, 

And willed my soul's salvation : 
He turned to me a Father's heart. 
Not small the cost ! to heal my smart, 

He gave His best and dearest. 

He spake to His beloved son : 
'Tis time to take compassion ; 

Then go, bright jewel of my crown, 
And bring to man salvation ; 

From sin and sorrow set him jfree. 

Slay bitter death for him, that he 
May live with thee for ever. 



48 



The Son obeyed right cheerfully, 
And born of virgin mother 

Came down upon the earth to me, 
That he might be my brother : 

His mighty power doth work unseen, 

He came in fashion poor and mean, 
And took the devil captive. 

He sweetly said : * Hold fast by Me, 
I am thy Rock and Castle, 

Thy Eansom I myself will be. 
For thee I strive and wrestle : * 

For I am thine, thou mine also. 

And where I am, thou art ; the foe 
ShaU never more divide us. 

For he shall shed my precious blood, 

Me of my life bereaving ; 
All this I suffer for thy good, 

Be stedfast and believing : 
Life shall from Death the victory win, 
My innocence shall bear thy sin, 

So art thou blest for ever. 



49 



Now to my Father I depart 

From earth to heaven ascending. 

Thence heavenly wisdom to impart 
The Holy Spirit sending ; 

He shall in trouble comfort thee. 

Teach thee to know and follow me, 
And to the truth conduct thee. 

What I have done and taught, do thou 
To do and teach endeavour, 

So shall my kingdom flourish now. 
And God be praised for ever : 

Take heed lest men with base alloy 

The heavenly treasure should destroy ; 
This counsel I bequeath thee. 

Amen.

The 128th Psalm. 
(1524.) 

Happy the man, who feaxeth God, 
Whose feet His holy ways have trod : 
Thine own good hand shall nourish thee. 
And well and happy shalt thou be. 

Thy wife shall like a fruitful vine 
Fill all thy house with clusters fine ; 
Thy children all be fresh and sound, 
Like olive plants thy table round. 

Lo ! to the man these blessings cleave. 
Who in God's holy fear doth live ; 
From him the ancient curse hath fled 
By Adam's race inherited. 

51 



Out of Mount Zion God shall send, 
And crown with joy thy latter end ; 
That thou Jerusalem mayst see 
In favour and prosperity. 

He shall be with thee in thy ways, 
And give thee health and length of days ; 
Yea thou shalt children's children see, 
And peace on Israel shall be.

That men a godly life might live, 
God did these ten Commandments give 
By His true servant Moses, high 
Upon the Mount of Sinai. 

Kyrie eleison. 

I am thy God and Lord alone, 
No other God beside Me own ; 
Put thy whole confidence in Me, 
And love me in sincerity. 

Eyrie eleison. 

By idle word and speech profane 
Take not My Holy Name in vain ; 
And praise not aught as good and true 
But what God doth both say and do. 

Eyrie eleison. 

55 



Hallow the day which God hath blest, 
That thou and all thy house may rest ; 
Keep hand and heart from labour free. 
That God may have His work in thee. 

Kyrie eleison. 

Give to thy parents honour due, 
Be dutiful, and loving too ; 
And help them, when their strength decays. 
So shall God give thee length of days. 

Kyrie eleison. 

Harbour no hatred, nor ill will. 
Lest hate breed anger, and thou kill ; 
Be patient and of gentle mood, 
And to thine enemy do good. 

Kyrie eleison. 

Be fiiithful to thy marriage vows. 
Thy heart give only to thy spouse ; 
Keep thy life pure, and lest thou sin. 
Use temperance and discipline. 

Kyrie eleison. 

56 



Steal not, oppressive acts abhor. 

Nor wring their life-blood from the poor ; 

But open wide thy loving hand 

To all the needy in the land. 

Kyrie eleison. 

Bear not false witness, nor belie 
Thy neighbour by foul calumny ; 
Defend his innocence from blame, 
And hide with charity his shame. 

Kyrie eleison. 

Thy neighbour's wife desire thou not, 
His house, nor aught that he hath got ; 
But wish that his such good may be. 
As thine own heart doth wish for thee. 

Kyrie eleison. 



God these Commandments gave, therein 
To shew thee, son of man, thy sin, 
And make thee also well perceive. 
How unto God man ought to live. 

Kyrie eleison. 

67 



Help us, Lord Jesu Christ, for we 
A Mediator have in Thee ; 
Without Thy help our works are vain, 
And merit only endless pain.

OuK Father dear, which art in Heaven, 
And hast to us commandment given, 
That we should pray and call on Thee 
As members of one family. 
Grant that our prayers be not mere soimd, 
But breathings from the heart's deep ground. 

Thy Name be hallowed ! help us, Lord, 
To keep in purity Thy word, 
That we may live, as Christians ought, 
Holy in word and deed and thought : 
Keep us, O Lord, from aU false lore. 
The poor deceived folk restore.

Thy Kingdom come, O Lord, in power. 
Both at this time, and evermore ; 
And let the Holy Ghost be nigh. 
His gifts and graces to supply ; 
Break Satan's power, defeat his rage. 
Preserve the Church, Thine Heritage. 

Thy will be done, Lord God, in love. 
On earth, as 'tis in Heaven above ; 
Patience in time of grief bestow, 
Obedience in weal and woe ; 
Curb flesh and blood, or any ill 
That sets itself against Thy will. 

Give us our daily bread this day. 
For needful things alone we pray ; 
From war and strife be our defence. 
From &mine and from pestilence ; 
That we may live in godly peace. 
Free from all care and avarice. 

Forgive our sins, the burden sore 
Remove, that it affiict no more. 



62 



As we forgive both great and small 
Their debts and their offences all ; 
Make us delight in serving Thee 
In perfect love and unity. 

Into temptation lead us not, 
When Satan doth against us plot ; 
Upon the left hand and the right 
O help us valiantly to fight. 
Firm in the faith, an armed host, 
Through comfort of the Holy Ghost. 

From evil. Lord, deliver us. 
The times and days are perilous ; 
O save us from eternal death. 
And comfort us in our last breath ; 
Grant us a blessed end, and take 
Our souls to Thee for Jesus' sake. 

Amen, Amen : so let it be ! 

Strengthen our faith continually, 

That so we firmly may believe. 

What we here ask we shall receive. 

Since in Thy Name, and at Thy Word 

We pray to Thee. Amen, O Lord.

A spiritual song concerning our holy Baptism, 



(1543.) 



To Jordan came our Lord the Christ, 

To do God's pleasure willing, 
And there was by Saint John baptized. 

All righteousness fulfilling ; 
There did He consecrate a bath 

To wash away transgression, 
And quench the bitterness of death 

By His own blood and passion ; 

He woidd a new life give us. 

So hear ye all and well perceive 
What God doth call Baptism, 

69 



And what a Christian should believe, 

Who error shuns and schism : 
That we should water use, the Lord 

Declareth it His pleasure, 
Not simple water, but the Word 

And Spirit without measure ; 

He is the true Baptizer. 

To shew us this. He hath His Word 
With signs and symbols given ; 

On Jordan's banks was plainly heard 
The Father's voice from heaven : 

'* This is my well-beloved Son, 
In whom my soul delighteth. 

Hear Him : " yea hear Him every one 
Whom He Himself inviteth. 
Hear and obey His teaching. 

In tender manhood Jesus straight 

To holy Jordan wendeth ; 
The Holy Ghost from heaven's gate 

In dove-like shape descendeth ; 
That thus the truth be not denied, 

Nor should our faith e'er waver, 

70 



That the three Persons all preside 
At Baptism's holy laver. 
And dwell with the Believer. 

Thus Jesus His Disciples sent : 

Go, teach ye every nation, 
That lost in sin they must repent, 

And flee from condemnation : 
He that believes and is baptized. 

Obtains a mighty blessing, 
A new-bom man, no more he dies. 

Eternal life possessing, 

A joyful heir of heaven. 

Who in this mercy hath not faith, 

Nor aught therein discerneth. 
Is yet in sin, condemned to death, 

And fire that ever buineth ; 
His holiness avails him not. 

Nor aught which he is doing, 
His birth-sin brings it all to naught. 

And maketh sure his iniin ; 

Himself he cannot succour. 



71 E 2 



The eye of sense alone is dim, 
And nothing sees but water ; 

Faith sees Christ Jesus, and in Him 
The lamb ordained for slaughter ; 

She sees the cleansing fountain red 
With the dear blood of Jesus, 

Which from the sins inherited 
From fallen Adam frees us. 
And those we have committed. 



-(£.-(5^4is.#^>fi--^ 



72 



(1524.) 

From depths of woe I raise to Thee 

The voice of lamentation. 
Lord, turn a gracious ear to me, 

And hear my supplication : 
If Thou should' st be extreme to mark 
Each secret sin and misdeed dark, 

Oh ! who could stand before Thee ? 

To wash away the crimson stain, 
Grace, Grace alone availeth ; 

Our works alas ! are all in vain. 
In much the best life faileth : 

No man can glory in Thy sight. 

All must alike confess Thy might. 
And live alone by mercy. 



73 



I 



I 



Therefore my trust is in the Lord, 
And not in mine own merit ; 

On Him my soul shall rest, His Word 
Upholds my fainting spirit ; 

His promised mercy is my fort, 

My comfort and my sweet support, 
I wait for it with patience. 

What though I wait the livelong night, 
And till the dawn appeareth. 

My heart still trusteth in His might. 
It doubteth not, nor feareth ; 

So let the Israelite in heart. 

Born of the Spirit, do his part. 
And wait till God appeareth. 

Although our sin is great indeed, 
God's mercies far exceed it, 

His hand can give the help we need, 
However much we need it : 

He is the Shepherd of the sheep. 

Who Israel doth guard and keep. 
And shall from sin redeem him.

I. 



Christ who freed our souls from danger, 
And hath turned away God's anger, 
Suffered pains no tongue can tell. 
To redeem us from pains- of hell. 

That we never might forget it. 
Take my flesh, He said, and eat it, 
Hidden in this piece of bread, 
Drink my blood in this wine, He said. 

Whoso to this board repaireth. 
Take good heed how he prepareth ; 
Death instead of life shall he 
Find, who cometh unworthily. 

75 



Praise the Father, God in Heaven, 
Who such dainty food hath given, 
And for misdeeds thou hast done 
Gave to die His beloved Son. 

Trust God's word, it is intended 
For the sick who would be mended, 
Those whose heavy-laden breast 
Groans with sin, and is seeking rest. 

To such grace and mercy tumeth 
Every soul that truly moumeth ; 
Art thou well ? avoid this board, 
Else thou reapest an ill reward. 

Lo ! He saith Himself, " Ye weary, 
Come to Me, and I will cheer ye," 
Needless were the Leech's skill 
To the souls that be strong and well. 

Could' st thou earn thine own salvation, 
Useless were my death and passion ; 
Wilt thou thine own helper be ? 
No meet table is this for thee. 

76 



If thou this believest truly 

And confession makest duly, 

Thou a welcome guest art here, 

This rich banquet thy soul shall cheer. 



Sweet henceforth shall be thy labour, 
Thou shalt truly love thy neighbour, 
So shall he both taste and see 
What thy Saviour hath done in thee.

These things the Seer Isaiah did befall ;

On a high throne raised up in splendour bright, 
His garment's border filled the choir with light. 
Beside Him stood two Seraphim, which had 
Six wings, wherewith they both aUke were clad : 
With twain they hid their shining face, with twain 
They hid their feet as with a flowing train, 
And with the other twain they both did fly. 
One to the other thus aloud did cry. 
Holy is God, the Lord of Sabaoth ! 
Holy is God, the Lord of Sabaoth ! 
Holy is God, the Lord of Sabaoth !

In the darkest night is seen, 
Come, inspire my feeble strain. 
That I may not sing in vain. 

God's own finger, skilled to teach 
Tongues of every land and speech. 
Balsam of the wounded soul. 
Binding up and making whole, 
Flame of pure and holy love. 
Strength of all that live and move. 
Come, Thy gifts and fire impart. 
Make me love Thee from the heart. 



89 



Bridegroom of believing souls ! 
Let me in the sheltering holes 
Of the Rock of Ages find 
Refuge from the stormy wind ; 
Like a bird unto its nest, 
Flee away and be at rest : 
Shine Thou Sun of grace and bliss, 
Breathe upon me with Thy kiss. 



Precious gift by God bestowed ! 
Come and make me Thine abode. 
See ! I languish, see ! I faint, 
Listen to my sad complaint, 
Come, oh ! come to me, my Love, 
Come with unction from above, 
That my heart may smile anew 
At Thy soul-entrancing view. 



As the hart with longing looks 
For refreshing water-brooks. 
Heated in the burning chase ; 
So my soul desires Thy grace, 

90 



So my heavy laden breast. 
By the cares of life opprest, 
Longs Thy cooling streams to taste 
In this dry and barren waste. 



Mighty Spirit, by whose aid 
Man a living soul was made. 
Everlasting God, whose fire 
Kindles chaste and pure desire ! 
Grant in every grief and loss 
I may calmly bear the Cross, 
And surrender all to Thee, 
Comforting and strengthening me. 



Lord, to Thy safe keeping take, 
When I sleep and when I wake, 
Every feature, limb and bone, 
Every thing I call my own ; 
That each word, and work, and way, 
And e'en this my himible lay. 
May, O heavenly Father, be 
Good and pleasing imto Thee. 

91 



Let not Hell with frowns or smiles. 
Open force or.cunning wiles, 
Snap the thread of my brief days ; 
And when gently life decays, 
Take to Heaven Thy servant dear. 
Who hath loved and served Thee here. 
There eternal hymns to raise, 
Mighty Spirit, to Thy praise. 

Amen.
