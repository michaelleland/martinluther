Luther's Small Catechism.
Foreword.
Martin Luther to all the faithful and godly pastors and preachers, grace, mercy and peace in Jesus Christ our Lord.
1.	The deplorable condition in which I found the religious affairs of your parishes on my recent visit of inspection has impelled me to publish this concise and simple Catechism. Merciful God, what wretched ignorance I beheld! The common people—especially in the villages—apparently have no knowledge whatever of Christian doctrine, and even many pastors are ignorant and incapable teachers.
Though all are called Christians and have the privilege • of the sacraments, yet they cannot even repeat the Lord’s Prayer, nor the Creed, nor the Ten Commandments. They live like the brutes, and having now the light of the Gospel, rankly abuse their Christian liberty.
2.	You bishops, what answer will you be able to make to Christ for having so shamefully neglected the people and utterly disregarded your office ? But I invoke no evil upon you. You withhold the Holy Supper in part, and insist upon the observance of your own traditions, while utterly indifferent about teaching the people the Lord’s Prayer, the Creed, the Ten Commandments or any part of the Word of God. Woe, woe unto you!
I beseech you, then, in the name of God, my beloved brethren—pastors or preachers—to sincerely discharge the duties of your office, to have pity on the people entrusted to your care, and to help us to acquaint them with the Cate-

chism, especially the young. And if you have not the requisite knowledge of such things take these forms and read them to the people, word for word, proceeding in the following manner:	
3.	First, let the preacher particularly beware of variations in the form, or wording, of the Ten Commandments, the Lord’s Prayer, the Creed, the sacraments. Let him adhere to one form year after year. For the young and the unlearned cannot be taught with success unless we keep to the same forms and expressions. They are easily confused when we teach a thing in a certain form at one time, and at another time—as if endeavoring to improve it—employ a different version. In the latter way our labor and toil are lost.
The worthy fathers clearly recognized this fact. They used the same form for the Lord’s Prayer, the Creed and the Ten Commandments. We should likewise follow their plan in teaching the young and the unlearned, changing not one syllable nor varying in any wise tomorrow what we preach today.
4.	Choose, then, the form that you prefer and ever keep to it. When you preach to the learned and wise, however, you are at liberty to show your skill, and to present these articles in all the varied forms at your command. But with the young, keep ever to one form; and teach them, first of all, the Ten Commandments, the Creed, the Lord’s Prayer, etc., word for word according to the text, that thus they may easily repeat and remember them.
5.	If any refuse to learn, tell them that they deny Christ and are not Christians. They must not be admitted to the Lord’s Supper, nor to the privilege of being sponsors at infant baptism, nor enjoy any of our Christian liberties; they must be commended to the pope and his agents, and even to the devil himself. More than this, their parents and masters should refuse them food and drink and notify them that the government will banish such incorrigibles from the country.
Though we cannot and may not force any to believe, yet we must instruct and train the multitude to distinguish between right and wrong conduct toward those with whom

they would live and obtain a livelihood. He who would dwell in the city and enjoy its privileges as blessings from God, must know and obey its laws, whether he truly believes or is a rogue and vicious at heart.
6.	In the second place, when those you instruct know the text well, teach them the meaning of the words. Take the explanation presented in these forms, or any other that is brief, and hold to it without altering a syllable, just as before with the words of the text; and allow ample time for the lessons. It is not necessary to take up all of a topic at once. For instance, when the people thoroughly understand the first commandment, take the second, and so on; otherwise they will be overburdened and retain nothing.
7.	In the third place, when you have finished the Small Catechism, begin with the Large Catechism and give the words a more comprehensive explanation. Explain each commandment, petition and article, with the various duties which they impose; teach the blessings and the dangers incident to its observance and neglect. These points you will find well treated in many writings. Emphasize particularly those parts most neglected or least understood by your people. For example, the seventh commandment, which deals with stealing, you must urge upon artisans, dealers and even upon farmers and servants, among whom many are dishonest and unfaithful. Likewise, you must faithfully instill the teaching of the fourth commandment upon children and the uneducated, that they may be quiet, faithful, obedient and peaceable; and illustrate this commandment by many examples from the Scriptures where God punished or blessed in accordance with its teaching.
8.	Here, too, urge magistrates and parents to rule wisely and to educate the children, reminding them of their bound-ing duty therein and of their grievous sin if they neglect it; for, failing in this respect, they do injury to God’s kingdom and to temporal government, making themselves the most harmful enemies of God and man. And make plain to them the awful wrong they commit when they refuse their aid in training children for the ministry and other professional

19
spheres, and show that for such a sin God will send upon them terrible punishment. Time and place render preaching on this subject imperative. Parents and magistrates sin in this respect to an immeasurable degree; and Satan fosters their sin with most evil designs.
9.	Finally:	Now that the people are relieved of the
tyranny of the pope, they never come to the Lord’s Supper, but treat it with contempt. To this duty, then, they must be persuaded. However, we must not force any to believe or to partake of the Lord’s Supper; we must not make laws on this point or dictate time and place. But our preaching must influence the people to come and demand, as it were, that we give them the sacrament. To attain this influence, we must say to them: It is to be feared that he who does not desire to partake of the Lord’s Supper at least three or four times during the year, apparently despises it, and that he is no Christian at all; just as he who refuses to believe and hear the Gospel is not a Christian. For Christ did not say: “Neglect, or despise, this;” he said, “This do, as oft as ye drink it.” 
It is his command that the sacrament shall be observed. He will not have it despised or neglected. He says, “This do.”
10.	He who does not consider the Holy Supper of inestimable value, apparently knows no sin, no flesh, no devil, no world, no death, no danger, no hell; that is, he does not believe in them although he is overwhelmed in them and is completely the devil’s. On the other hand, he has no need of mercy, of life, of paradise and the kingdom of heaven, of Christ and God, nor of any good thing. For if he believed himself overwhelmed with evils and in need of so many blessings he could not neglect the Lord’s Supper, which gives effectual remedy for evil and bestows abundant good. He would not need to be driven to the sacrament by any law, but would hasten to it of his own accord, impelled by his own desires, and would urge you to administer it to him.
11.	Therefore, you must in this case establish no law, as the pope has done. Only set forth the benefit and the harm, the need and the blessing, the danger and the salvation, involved in the Lord’s Supper, and the people will seek it of their own accord and without constraint. 
If they refuse to come, leave them to their choice and tell them that since they regard not their own spiritual need and God’s gracious help, they belong to the devil. But if you do not so warn them, or if you turn the sacrament into a law, which means to inject poison into it, then you are to blame if the people despise the sacrament. Must they not of necessity be indifferent if you are asleep or silent on the matter? Therefore, take earnest heed, you pastors and preachers. Our office is utterly changed from what it was formerly, under the pope. 
It is now the ministry of salvation; consequently, it brings us greater responsibility and labor, more dangers and temptations. 
It brings us also but little gratitude or reward in this world; but Christ himself will be our reward if we faithfully labor. 
May the father of all grace help us, to whom be praise and thanks forever, through Christ our Lord. 
Amen.
